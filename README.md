# üöÄ Quickstart

<br>

### Installation

To add the VideoDB Player library to your project, use the following command in your project's directory:

```bash
npm install videodb-player
```

### Usage

To use the VideoDB Player in your Vue.js application, import the necessary components and styles:

```html
<script setup>
  import { VideoDBPlayer } from "videodb-player";
  import "videodb-player/dist/style.css";
</script>

<template>
  <VideoDBPlayer
    class="player"
    streamUrl="https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/12df6498-e955-4249-84b8-7568aaf72160.m3u8"
  >
  </VideoDBPlayer>
</template>

<style scoped>
  .player {
    width: 90vw;
  }
</style>
```

<br>

# üßë‚Äçüíª Advanced Usage

### üß© Slots

`<VideoDBPlayer/>` has two different [slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html) available to add Custom UI components on top of `VideoDBPlayer`.

- `overlay`
- `controls`

Child Components can access the player state by [injecting](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html#inject) the state [provided](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html#provide) under `videodb-player` key.
Checkout [Accessing State Inside Child Components of `VideoDBPlayer`](#-accessing-player-state-inside-child-components-of-videodbplayer) Section for more details

![slots](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90276518-0a72-4be1-b293-2c6b1309c66a)

<br>

### üîß Custom Controls

To create custom controls for the VideoDBPlayer component, you can utilize the provided slot feature. First, you'll need to disable the default controls by setting the `defaultControls` prop to `false`. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<VideoDBPlayer
  streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
  :defaultControls="false"
>
  <template #controls>
    <YourCustomControls />
  </template>
</VideoDBPlayer>
```

<br>

### üîß Custom overlay

Similar to disabling the default controls, you can disable the default overlay by setting the `defaultOverlay` prop to `false` within the VideoDBPlayer component:

```html
<VideoDBPlayer
  streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
  :defaultOverlay="false"
>
  <template #overlay>
    <YourCustomOverlay />
  </template>
</VideoDBPlayer>
```

<br>

### üîé Using `<SearchInsideMedia/>` Component

The `<SearchInsideMedia/>` component enables in-video search functionality. To use it:

1. Disable the default overlay in `<VideoDBPlayer>`.
2. Add the `<SearchInsideMedia/>` component in the `#overlay` slot.
3. To get the search results from Video you can use [VideoDB](https://videodb.io).
   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [video-agents](https://github.com/video-db/video-agents) for full integration guide which includes backend for video agents & integration with [videodb-chat](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-chat)

```html
<template>
  <VideoDBPlayer
    ref="playerRef"
    streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
    :defaultOverlay="false"
  >
    <template #overlay>
      <BigCenterButton class="center-button" />
      <SearchInsideMedia
        :search-content="searchContent"
        :search-results="searchResults"
        :search-results-loading="searchResultsLoading"
        :show-search-results="showSearchResults"
        @toggle-results="showSearchResults = $event"
        @search-change="handleSearchChange"
        @search-submit="handleSearchSubmit"
      />
    </template>
  </VideoDBPlayer>
</template>

<style scoped>
  .center-button {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
  }
</style>
```

<br>

### üßë‚Äçüíª Accessing Player State Inside Child Components of `VideoDBPlayer`

The player state and methods are provided through the Vue composition API. You can access them using the `useVideoDBPlayer` hook in Child Components of `VideoDBPlayer`:

```html
<script setup>
  import { useVideoDBPlayer } from "videodb-player";
  const {
    playing,
    volume,
    duration,
    time,
    togglePlay,
    setVolume,
    // ... other properties and methods
    // checkout reference for more details
  } = useVideoDBPlayer();
</script>
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoDBPlayer interface](#videodbplayer) for more details

<br>

### üßë‚Äçüíª Accessing Player Instance

The VideoDB Player exposes its internal player instance through a ref.
Its useful for accessing player methods and state from outside the component

```html
<template>
  <VideoDBPlayer ref="playerRef" streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8" />
</template>

<script setup>
  import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
  import { VideoDBPlayer } from "videodb-player";

  const playerRef = ref(null);

  onMounted(() => {
    playerRef.value.togglePlay();
    // ... other exposed methods & variable
    // checkout reference for more details
  });
</script>
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoDBPlayer interface](#videodbplayer) for more details

<br>

### üîî Events

The VideoDB Player emits several events that you can listen to in the parent component:

1. `play`: Emitted when the video starts playing.
2. `pause`: Emitted when the video is paused.
   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoDBPlayer interface](#videodbplayer) for full list of events

Example usage:

```html
<template>
  <VideoDBPlayer
    @play="onPlay"
    @pause="onPause"
    streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
  import { VideoDBPlayer } from "videodb-player";

  const onPlay = () => {
    console.log("Video started playing");
  };

  const onPause = () => {
    console.log("Video paused");
  };
</script>
```
